Penetration testing involves simulating real-world cyberattacks in a controlled environment to identify exploitable vulnerabilities, focusing on critical systems, network architecture, and sensitive data through a goal-oriented and often manual process conducted by ethical hackers. In contrast, vulnerability assessments are broader, automated evaluations that identify, categorize, and quantify known security weaknesses across systems, typically targeting non-critical environments. While penetration testing reveals how vulnerabilities can be exploited, vulnerability assessments help organizations understand their overall risk posture and provide mitigation strategies to reduce those risks.",
